# Virtual Library Project

This repository contains a university project for creating a **Virtual Library** application using **C++** and the **Qt framework**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a desktop application that allows users to manage a digital library. The application supports various types of media, such as books, music, films, photographs, and video games.

Key features include:

- Adding, editing, and removing library items
- Searching and filtering items by different criteria
- Viewing detailed information for each item
- Saving and loading library data in JSON and XML formats
- A graphical user interface built with Qt

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language for the application logic
- **Qt**: Framework for the graphical user interface (GUI)
- **JSON/XML**: Formats for saving and reading library data

## Usage

To run the project, open the `.pro` file with Qt Creator, build the project, and run the application. You can then interact with the library through the graphical interface.

## Notes

This project is developed for educational purposes as part of a university course assignment.
